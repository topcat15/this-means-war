# this-means-war

The game of a war. You know, with playing cards. This is my first project written in Swift a tool to help me learn how to write object-oriented code.

Please keep in mind this is a work in progress. For example, if you run this in XCode, use an iPhone 11 sim. The animations are not dynamic - the transition values are hard-coded, as a means to an end - so it won't really work in its current state on another device. This will eventually be corrected!
